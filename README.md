# Python and Cursor: Smarter Development with AI

This repository contains my projects from the **Santander course "Python and Cursor: Smarter development with AI"**. The course focuses on leveraging AI-powered development tools to enhance Python programming productivity and explore various programming concepts.

## üöÄ Projects Overview

### 1. **Calculator** (`With Cursor/Calculator.py`)
A simple interactive calculator that demonstrates basic Python control flow and user input handling.

**Features:**
- Interactive command-line interface
- Supports four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Input validation and error handling
- Division by zero protection
- Continuous operation until user chooses to exit

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Python loops and conditional statements
- User input processing and validation
- Exception handling with try-catch blocks
- Clean program flow control

### 2. **Data Analysis** (`With Cursor/DataAnalysis.py`)
A data science project that showcases pandas and matplotlib integration for basic statistical analysis.

**Features:**
- CSV file reading with pandas
- Statistical calculations (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Interactive scatter plot visualization
- Automatic column detection for plotting
- Professional plot formatting with labels and grids

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Data manipulation with pandas
- Statistical analysis fundamentals
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Working with real datasets

### 3. **Word Counter** (`With Cursor/WordCounter.py`)
A text analysis tool that processes text files and provides word frequency statistics.

**Features:**
- Robust file path handling (supports quoted paths)
- UTF-8 encoding support with error handling
- Advanced word tokenization using regex
- Word frequency analysis with Counter
- Top 10 most frequent words display
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- File I/O operations
- Text processing and regular expressions
- Collections module usage
- Error handling for file operations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **re** - Regular expressions for text processing
- **collections** - Advanced data structures

## üìã Prerequisites
